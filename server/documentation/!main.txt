making modules:
    make a python file and put it in the modules folder

    at the bottom of the file add a dictionary of api calls:
        formatted like: {"module-call1":function}, when a websocket sends the first string the server will run said function
        the function must be an async function:
            it must have one argument, that being a dictionary of some needed items:
                {
                    "websocket": websocket object, can run .send and .recive among others
                    "deviceName": name of device connected
                    "modules": dictionary of all modules installed {"module1",moduleClass}, can be used to use other modules functions
                }

    add a description and a documentation variable, both strings to be listed on server start
